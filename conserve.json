    "protectedInfo":"Sri Lanka is home to a diverse array of protected animals, encompassing both terrestrial and marine species. Among these are iconic creatures such as the Sri Lankan elephant (Elephas maximus maximus), which roams in significant numbers within protected areas like Udawalawe and Yala National Parks. The island's leopard (Panthera pardus kotiya), recognized as a distinct subspecies, thrives in habitats ranging from dense jungles to dry scrublands. The Sloth bear (Melursus ursinus inornatus), native to Sri Lanka, is another flagship species protected within the island's wildlife reserves. In the marine realm, Sri Lanka's coastal waters shelter various endangered marine mammals, including the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis) and the dugong (Dugong dugon), a vulnerable marine mammal frequently observed in the waters of Palk Bay and the Gulf of Mannar. These and many other species contribute to the rich tapestry of biodiversity safeguarded by Sri Lanka's conservation efforts.",
